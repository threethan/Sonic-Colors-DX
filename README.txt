 Hi, I'm threethan, and I'm responsible for this project.

 Sonic Colors DX is intended to be the best way to play, in my opinion greatly surpassing SEGA's own botched rerelease
 Various visual changes have been made, in order to replicate the shading of Sonic Unleashed, which Color's is largely based on
 while also allowing for good performance at 60fps, uncapped resolution.
 
 Playing this at default settings will require a decent (though not neccessarily high end) gaming PC.
 If you cannot consistantly reach 60fps, check the "Performance" section

 Keep in mind it would not be legal for me to distribute the original game files,
 so you will need to obtain a rip of the game yourself. MAKE SURE IT IS AN ISO!!!

 If you are a content creator, please do share and link your content!
 I would love to see comparisons with Ultimate made, people need to be more aware of emulation and have higher standards for remasters ;p

Windows:
 I've made things as simple as possible, but a little bit of manual setup is still required.
 Simply run the "Sonic Colors DX.exe" and it will guide you through the <5 minute setup.

If you are NOT on Windows, you can still play using the following manual setup process:
 Prerequisites: Sonic Colors iso, A cpk unpacker for your platform that is functional with Color's older version of the format

 - Download Ishiiruka-Dolphin for you platform here:
	https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-unofficial-ishiiruka-dolphin-custom-version
 - Make a file named 'portable.txt' in your Ishiiruka-Dolphin folder
  then copy "User" from "Sonic Colors DX/Resources/Ishiiruka-Dolphin/" to YOUR "Ishiiruka-Dolphin" folder
 - Launch YOUR "Ishiiruka-Dolphin," add the path to Sonic Colors so it will show up in the game list, and extract disc
	(Right click 'Sonic Colors' > Properties > Filesystem > Right click 'Disc' > Extract disc)
 - Go to the newly extracted game, and navigate to DATA>files>sonic_2010_0.cpk and extract it with a CPK unpacker
 - Copy the contents of "Sonic Colors DX/Resources/modded files" into the extracted cpk, overwriting all
 - Recompress the CPK and replace the old one within the extracted game files
 - Run YOUR version of "Ishiiruka-Dolphin", remove the iso from paths to avoid confusion
 - Open "DATA\sys\main.dol" from your extracted & modified copy of the game
 - Enjoy!

 Having FPS under 60? Try the following:

Set a static resolution. By default the game will run at whatever resolution your display is.
- Launch the game, tab out to the dolphin window
- In the dolphin window, click "Graphics"
- Select "Internal Resolution" in the general tab and change it to one of the lower options

Remove Post Processing (this will make the game look considerably worse)
- Launch the game, tab out to the dolphin window
- In the dolphin window, click "Graphics"
- Switch to the "Post-Processing" tab
- Select "IsgurukaFX-Light" if it is not already, then press remove
